# Kisan Mitra: Speech-Based Knowledge Retrieval for Sandalwood Cultivation

## Overview
Kisan Mitra is a speech-based solution designed to bridge the knowledge gap in Sandalwood cultivation, enabling farmers and laypersons to access valuable insights seamlessly. By leveraging advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Question-Answering (QA) technologies, this project processes colloquial Kannada audio resources, transcribes them, and makes them searchable for relevant information. Our system is tailored to handle real-world challenges like informal language usage and noisy environments, ensuring reliable and accessible knowledge dissemination to improve agricultural practices and Sandalwood conservation efforts.


This repository contains all the code, datasets, and documentation for building and deploying the Kisan Mitra pipeline.
